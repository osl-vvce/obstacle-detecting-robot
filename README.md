# obstacle-detecting-robot

Almost all navigation robot demands the some sort of obstacle detection, hence obstacle avoidance strategy is of most importance. Obstacle Avoidance Robot has a vast field of application. They can be used as services robots, for the purpose of household work and so many other indoor applications. Equally they have great importance in scientific exploration and emergency rescue, there may be places that are dangerous for humans or even impossible for humans to reach directly, then we should use robots to help us. In those challenging environments, the robots need to gather information about their surroundings to avoid obstacles. Nowadays, even in ordinary environments, people require that robots to detect and avoid obstacles. For example, an industrial robot in a factory is expected to avoid workers so that it wonâ€™t hurt them. In conclusion, obstacle avoidance is widely researched and applied in the world, and it is probable that most robots in the future should have obstacle avoidance function.
